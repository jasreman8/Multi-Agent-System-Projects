        "\n",
        "Manual employee onboarding can be:\n",
        "- Time-consuming: HR, IT, and hiring managers spend significant time on repetitive tasks.\n",
        "- Error-prone: Manual data entry and task tracking can lead to mistakes, such as incorrect account setup or missed steps.\n",

        "- Delayed: Bottlenecks in one department can delay the entire process, impacting the new hire's productivity from day one.\n",

        "The proposed system in this notebook uses a chain of three specialized AI agents to automate key onboarding tasks:\n",
