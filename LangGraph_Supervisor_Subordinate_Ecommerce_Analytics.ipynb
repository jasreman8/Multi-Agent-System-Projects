        "**Scenario:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine an e-commerce company, \"TechNova Inc.,\" that sells various tech products like laptops (\"QuantumLeap Laptop\") and tablets (\"StellarPad Tablet\"). The product management and sales strategy teams frequently need answers to complex questions that require combining information from different sources.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Problem:**\n",
        "Answering queries like \"How did our QuantumLeap Laptop sales in Q1 2024 compare to the estimated Q1 sales of its main competitor, the Apple MacBook Pro, if the MacBook Pro sold X units at its current price, and what's the percentage difference?\" is challenging for a single person or a simple bot. It involves:\n",
        "- Looking up internal sales data for the QuantumLeap Laptop.\n",
        "- Searching the web for the current price of the Apple MacBook Pro.\n",
        "- Performing calculations (estimating competitor revenue, calculating differences, percentages).\n",
        "- Potentially looking up internal product specifications.\n",
        "\n",
        "Different types of expertise are needed for these tasks. A single LLM agent might struggle to manage this complexity, choose the correct tools sequentially, or perform calculations reliably without explicit instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Solution using Supervisor-Subordinates:\n",
        "The code in this notebook implements a multi-agent system to address this:\n",
        "- **A Market Researcher Agent:** Specializes in finding external information (like competitor pricing via web search) and looking up details of TechNova's own products from an internal database.\n",
        "- **A Sales Analyst Agent:** Specializes in retrieving internal sales figures for TechNova's products and performing any necessary mathematical calculations.\n",
        "- **A Supervisor Agent:** Acts as a team lead. It receives the user's complex query, understands the different pieces of information and analysis required, and delegates sub-tasks to the appropriate specialist agent (Market Researcher or Sales Analyst). It then synthesizes the information from the agents to provide a comprehensive answer to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "- Modularity: Each agent has a clear responsibility and set of tools, making the system easier to develop, debug, and extend.\n",
        "- Specialization: Agents are configured with prompts and tools specific to their expertise, leading to more accurate and efficient task execution.\n",
        "- Improved Reasoning: The supervisor can break down complex problems into manageable sub-tasks, guiding the overall problem-solving process.\n",
        "- Scalability: New specialist agents can be added to the team as new types of tasks or data sources are introduced."

        "Here's how this multi-agent system is built, step-by-step:\n",
        "- Gather the \"Team's\" Tools:\n",
        "First, we create the specific tools our \"digital employees\" (*the agents*) will need to do their jobs. These tools are like specialized software or access permissions:\n",
        "    - A Calculator: For any math problems.\n",
        "    - A Web Searcher: To look up current information on the internet (e.g., competitor prices, news).\n",
        "    - A Product Database Access Tool: To get details about our own company's products (like specs and official prices) from an internal database.\n",
        "    - A Sales Data Access Tool: To fetch our company's sales figures (how many units were sold, revenue) from another internal database.\n",
        "- \"Hire\" Specialist \"Employees\" (Agents):\n",
        "Next, we define our specialist agents. Think of them as employees with specific job roles and skills:\n",
        "    - Market Researcher: This agent is an expert in using the web searcher and the product database tool. We instruct it to focus on finding information about competitors, market trends, and our own product details. We tell it not to do math or look at sales figures.\n",
        "    - Sales Analyst: This agent is skilled with the sales data access tool and the calculator. We instruct it to focus on retrieving our company's sales numbers and performing any calculations needed. We tell it not to search the web or look up general product specs.\n",
        "- Appoint a \"Supervisor\":\n",
        "We then create a \"supervisor\" agent. This agent is like a **manager**:\n",
        "    - It receives the main question or task from the user.\n",
        "    - It analyzes the question to figure out what steps are needed and which specialist is best for each step.\n",
        "    - It delegates the sub-tasks to either the Market Researcher or the Sales Analyst.\n",
        "    - It waits for them to complete their work and then puts all the pieces together to form the final answer for the user.\n",
        "- Define the Team's Workflow:\n",
        "We connect the supervisor and the specialist agents into an official workflow. This defines how they communicate and how tasks flow between them. The supervisor is the entry point and the coordinator.\n",
        "- Set Up Memory:\n",
        "We give the system a simple \"memory\" so it can keep track of the conversation, especially if a task involves multiple back-and-forth steps.\n",
        "- Run and Test:\n",
        "Finally, we give the system some example questions. We observe how the supervisor understands the query, assigns tasks to the Market Researcher and Sales Analyst, and how they use their tools to gather information and perform calculations to ultimately answer the user's request.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach creates a more organized and capable system than trying to make one single agent do everything."

It sets up a configuration for managing conversation state (like a session ID) and then runs the workflow with three different example queries. Each query is designed to test different aspects of the multi-agent system, such as delegation to specific agents, use of various tools, and handling of multi-step reasoning. The final response from the system and the full conversation history are printed for inspection.\n",

        "*   **Example 3:** A more complex query requiring multiple steps: web search (Market Researcher), calculation (Sales Analyst), internal sales data retrieval (Sales Analyst), and then more calculations (Sales Analyst) involving data from different sources. This demonstrates the supervisor's ability to orchestrate a sequence of actions across different agents.\n"
