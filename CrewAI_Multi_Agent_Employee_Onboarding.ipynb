        "\n",
        "Manual employee onboarding can be:\n",
        "- Time-consuming: HR, IT, and hiring managers spend significant time on repetitive tasks.\n",
        "- Error-prone: Manual data entry and task tracking can lead to mistakes, such as incorrect account setup or missed steps.\n",
        "- Inconsistent: The new hire experience can vary depending on who is handling the onboarding.\n",

For example, one tool creates an employee record in an HR system, another provisions an IT account, and another generates a welcome email. These tools are like specialized instruments that our AI specialists will use.\n",
        "- Assemble the Specialist Team (Agents): We then define several AI \"specialists\" (agents). Each specialist has a specific role (e.g., \"HR Coordinator,\" \"IT Provisioner,\" \"Welcome Coordinator\") and a clear goal. We equip each specialist with the particular tools they need to do their job. For instance, the HR Coordinator gets the tools for creating records and initiating background checks.\n",
        "- Design the Workflow (Tasks): Next, we break down the entire onboarding process into a series of sequential \"tasks.\" Each task is assigned to one of our specialists. We provide a clear description of what needs to be done in each task, what information it needs from previous tasks (if any), and what the expected outcome or output should look like. For example, the IT Provisioning task can only start after the HR Coordinator has successfully created an employee ID.\n",
        "- Form the Onboarding Crew and Kick Off: Finally, we gather all our specialists and their assigned tasks into an \"onboarding crew.\" We instruct this crew to execute the tasks one after another, in a predefined order. We start the process by giving the initial details of the new hire (name, email, job title, etc.) to the first specialist in the chain. The crew then works through the tasks automatically, with the output of one task becoming the input for the next, until the entire onboarding sequence is complete. The final consolidated result of all these steps is then provided.\n",
