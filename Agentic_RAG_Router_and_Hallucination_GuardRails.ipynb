Is it a question about specific, historical company data we have on file (like Tesla's financial reports from 2019-2023)? Or is it a more general question, perhaps about recent news or another company, that would require searching the internet? This decision is made by a \"Router.\"\n",

        "\n",

It asks: \"Is this answer actually supported by the evidence the specialist found?\"\n",

        "In this section, the workflow graph is assembled using LangGraph.\n",
        "1.  **Initialize Graph:** `workflow = StateGraph(WorkflowState)` creates a new stateful graph. `WorkflowState` (defined in Section 8) tells LangGraph the structure of the data that will be passed between nodes.\n",
        "2.  **Add Nodes:**\n",
        "    *   `workflow.add_node(\"node_name\", function_name)` adds each processing step (defined in Section 9) as a node in the graph. The first argument is a unique string name for the node, and the second is the callable (function) that executes the node's logic.\n",
        "    *   The node names (`\"rag_agent\"`, `\"web_search_agent\"`) are deliberately chosen to match the possible output values of the `RouteQuery.datasource` and the return values of `decide_after_hallucination_check` for routing.\n",
        "3.  **Define Edges:** Edges connect the nodes and define the flow of control.\n",
        "    *   **Conditional Edges from Router:** `workflow.add_conditional_edges(\"router\", lambda state: state[\"agent_choice\"], {...})`\n",
        "        *   This connects the \"router\" node to either \"rag\\_agent\" or \"web\\_search\\_agent\".\n",
        "        *   The second argument is a function that takes the current state and returns a key. Here, `lambda state: state[\"agent_choice\"]` directly uses the `agent_choice` field set by the router node.\n",
        "        *   The third argument is a dictionary mapping these keys to the names of the next nodes. So, if `agent_choice` is \"rag\\_agent\", it goes to the \"rag\\_agent\" node.\n",
        "    *   **Direct Edges to Hallucination Check:** `workflow.add_edge(\"rag_agent\", \"hallucination_check\")` and `workflow.add_edge(\"web_search_agent\", \"hallucination_check\")`\n",
        "        *   These create direct connections. After either the \"rag\\_agent\" or \"web\\_search\\_agent\" node finishes, the workflow will always proceed to the \"hallucination\\_check\" node.\n",
        "    *   **Conditional Edges from Hallucination Check:** `workflow.add_conditional_edges(\"hallucination_check\", decide_after_hallucination_check, {...})`\n",
        "        *   This connects the \"hallucination\\_check\" node to either an agent node (for a retry) or the `END` state.\n",
        "        *   The `decide_after_hallucination_check` function (from Section 10) determines the key (\"rag\\_agent\", \"web\\_search\\_agent\", or \"end\").\n",
        "        *   The dictionary maps these keys to the next node. `END` is a special LangGraph object representing the termination of the workflow.\n",
        "4.  **Compile Workflow:** `compiled_workflow = workflow.compile()` finalizes the graph structure and returns a runnable `CompiledGraph` object."
